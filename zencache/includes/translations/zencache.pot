The HTML Compressor class also handles the automatic cleanup of your cache directories to keep it from growing too large over time. Therefore, unless you have VERY little disk space there is no reason to set this to a lower value (even if your site changes dynamically quite often). If anything, you might like to increase this value which could help to further reduce server load. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/HTML-Compressor\" target=\"_blank\">learn more here</a>. We recommend setting this value to at least double that of your overall %1$s expiration time."
