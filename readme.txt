Comet Cache is an advanced WordPress caching plugin inspired by simplicity. Speed up your site (BIG time!) with an intelligent and easy-to-use cache.

== Description ==

If you care about the speed of your site, Comet Cache is one of those plugins that you absolutely MUST have installed :-) Comet Cache takes a real-time snapshot (building a cache) of every Page, Post, Category, Link, etc. These snapshots are then stored (cached) intuitively, so they can be referenced later, in order to save all of that processing time that has been dragging your site down and costing you money.

The Comet Cache plugin uses configuration options that you select from the options panel. See: **Comet Cache -› Options** in your Dashboard. Once a file has been cached, Comet Cache uses advanced techniques that allow it to recognize when it should and should not serve a cached version of the file. By default, Comet Cache does not serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes.

= Features =

- SIMPLE and well-documented configuration (just enable and you're all set!).
- Options to control the automatic cache clearing behavior for Home and Posts Page, Author Page, Category, Tag, and Custom Term Archives, Custom Post Type Archives, RSS/RDF/ATOM Feeds, and XML Sitemaps.
- URI exclusion patterns (now supporting wildcards too).
- User-Agent exclusion patterns (now supporting wildcards too).
- HTTP referrer exclusion patterns (now supporting wildcards too).
- The ability to set an automatic expiration time for cache files.
- Client-Side Caching (to allow double-caching in the client-side browser).
- Caching for 404 requests to reduce the impact of those requests on the server.
- RSS, RDF, and Atom Feed caching.
- The ability to cache or ignore URLs that contain query strings (GET Requests).
- Apache Optimizations to enable GZIP Compression.
- WP-CLI Compatibility.
- An Advanced Cache Plugin system for theme and plugin developers.

= Pro Features =

- The ability to cache logged-in users too! (VERY powerful, particularly for membership sites).

== Installation ==

**Quick Tip:** WordPress® can only deal with one cache plugin being activated at a time. Please uninstall any existing cache plugins that you've tried in the past. In other words, if you've installed W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, DB Cache Reloaded, or any other caching plugin, uninstall them all before installing Comet Cache. One way to check, is to make sure this file: `wp-content/advanced-cache.php` and/or `wp-content/object-cache.php` are NOT present; and if they are, delete these files BEFORE installing Comet Cache. Those files will only be present if you have a caching plugin already installed. If you don't see them, you're ready to install Comet Cache :-).

**A note for existing ZenCache users:** Comet Cache is the successor to ZenCache and will automatically detect any existing ZenCache options and migrate that options over to Comet Cache. For further details, please see the [migration FAQ](https://cometcache.com/r/zencache-migration-faq/).

= Comet Cache is Very Easy to Install =

1. Upload the `/comet-cache` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress®.
3. Navigate to the **Comet Cache** panel & enable it.

= How will I know Comet Cache is Working? =

First of all, make sure that you've enabled Comet Cache. After you activate the plugin in WordPress, go to the Comet Cache options panel and enable caching (you can't miss the big yellow checkbox). Then scroll to the bottom and click Save All Changes. All of the other options on that page are already pre-configured for typical usage. Skip them all for now. You can go back through all of these later and fine-tune things the way you like them.

Once Comet Cache has been enabled, **you'll need to log out** (and/or clear browser cookies). Cache files are NOT served to visitors who are logged in, and that includes you too :-) Cache files are NOT served to recent commenters either. If you've commented (or replied to a comment lately); please clear your browser cookies before testing.

**To verify that Comet Cache is working**, navigate your site like a normal visitor would. Right-click on any page (choose View Source), then scroll to the very bottom of the document. At the bottom, you'll find comments that show Comet Cache stats and information. You should also notice that page-to-page navigation is lightning fast compared to what you experienced prior to installing Comet Cache.

= Running Comet Cache On A WordPress® Multisite Installation =

WordPress® Multisite Networking is a special consideration in WordPress®. If Comet Cache is installed under a Multisite Network installation, it will be enabled for ALL blogs the same way. The centralized config options for Comet Cache, can only be modified by a Super Administrator operating on the main site. Comet Cache has internal processing routines that prevent configuration changes, including menu displays; for anyone other than a Super Administrator operating on the main site.

= EMERGENCY: If All Else Fails (How-To Remove Comet Cache) =

Ordinarily you can just deactivate Comet Cache from the plugins menu in WordPress. However, if you're having a more serious issue, please follow the instructions here.

1. Log into your site via FTP; perhaps using [FileZilla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joXUMhr8PhU).
2. Delete this file: `/wp-content/advanced-cache.php`
3. Delete this directory: `/wp-content/plugins/comet-cache/`
4. Remove this line from your `/wp-config.php` file: `define('WP_CACHE', TRUE);`

Comet Cache is now completely uninstalled and you can start fresh :-)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I already have ZenCache installed; how do I install Comet Cache? =

You should also notice that page-to-page navigation is lightning fast compared to what you experienced prior to installing Comet Cache.

= What is the downside to running Comet Cache? =

There is NOT one! Comet Cache is a MUST HAVE for every WordPress® powered site. In fact, we really can't think of any site running WordPress® that would want to be without it. To put it another way, the WordPress® software itself comes with a built in action reference for an `advanced-cache.php` file, because WordPress® developers realize the importance of such as plugin. The `/wp-content/advanced-cache.php` file is named as such, because the WordPress® developers expect it to be there when caching is enabled by a plugin. If you don't have the `/wp-content/advanced-cache.php` file yet, it is because you have not enabled Comet Cache from the options panel yet.

= So why does WordPress® need to be cached? =

To understand how Comet Cache works, first you have to understand what a cached file is, and why it is absolutely necessary for your site and every visitor that comes to it. WordPress® (by its very definition) is a database-driven publishing platform. That means you have all these great tools on the back-end of your site to work with, but it also means that every time a Post/Page/Category is accessed on your site, dozens of connections to the database have to be made, and literally thousands of PHP routines run in harmony behind-the-scenes to make everything jive. The problem is, for every request that a browser sends to your site, all of these routines and connections have to be made (yes, every single time). Geesh, what a waste of processing power, memory, and other system resources. After all, most of the content on your site remains the same for at least a few minutes at a time. If you've been using WordPress® for very long, you've probably noticed that (on average) your site does not load up as fast as other sites on the web. Now you know why!

In computer science, a cache (pronounced /kash/) is a collection of data duplicating original values stored elsewhere or computed earlier, where the original data is expensive to fetch (owing to longer access time) or to compute, compared to the cost of reading the cache. In other words, a cache is a temporary storage area where frequently accessed data can be stored for rapid access. Once the data is stored in the cache, it can be used in the future by accessing the cached copy rather than re-fetching or recomputing the original data.

= Where & why are the cache files stored on my server? =

The cache files are stored in a special directory: `/wp-content/cache/comet-cache`. This directory needs to remain writable, just like the `/wp-content/uploads` directory on many WordPress® installations. The `/comet-cache/cache` directory is where cache files reside. These files are stored using an intutive directory structure that named based on the request URL (`HTTPS/HTTP_HOST/REQUEST_URI`). See also: **Dashboard -› Comet Cache -› Cache Directory/Expiration Time** for further details.

Whenever a request comes in from someone on the web, Comet Cache checks to see if it can serve a cached file; e.g. it looks at the `HTTPS/HTTP_HOST/REQUEST_URI` environent variables, then it checks the `/comet-cache/cache` directory. If a cache file has been built already, and it matches an existing `HTTPS.HTTP_HOST.REQUEST_URI` combination; and it is not too old (see: **Dashboard -› Comet Cache -› Cache Directory/Expiration Time**), then it will serve that file instead of asking WordPress® to regenerate it. This adds tremendous speed to your site and reduces server load.

= What happens if a user logs in? Are cache files used then? =

By default, Comet Cache does NOT serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes. That being said, the Pro version of Comet Cache DOES make it possible to cache pages even when users ARE logged-in; adding even more speed! This is particularly helpful on membership sites; e.g. sites that run plugins like s2Member™ for instance.

= Will comments and other dynamic parts of my blog update immediately? =

It depends on your configuration of Comet Cache. There is an automatic expiration system (the garbage collector), which runs through WordPress® behind-the-scene, according to your Expiration setting (see: **Dashboard -› Comet Cache -› Cache Directory/Expiration Time**). There is also a built-in expiration time on existing files that is checked before any cache file is served up, which also uses your Expiration setting. In addition; whenever you update a Post or a Page, Comet Cache can automatically prune that particular file from the cache so it instantly becomes fresh again. Otherwise, your visitors would need to wait for the previous cached version to expire.

By default, Comet Cache does NOT serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes.

= How do I enable GZIP compression? Is GZIP supported? =

There is no need to use an `.htaccess` file with this plugin; caching is handled by WordPress®/PHP alone. That being said, if you also want to take advantage of GZIP compression (and we do recommend this), then you WILL need an `.htaccess` file to accomplish that part. This plugin fully supports GZIP compression on its output. However, it does not handle GZIP compression directly. We purposely left GZIP compression out of this plugin, because GZIP compression is something that should really be enabled at the Apache level or inside your `php.ini` file. GZIP compression can be used for things like JavaScript and CSS files as well, so why bother turning it on for only WordPress-generated pages when you can enable GZIP at the server level and cover all the bases!

If you want to enable GZIP and your site is running on the Apache web server, visit **Dashboard -> Comet Cache -> Apache Optimizations -> Enable GZIP Compression?**; or to enable GZIP compression manually create an `.htaccess` file in your WordPress® installation directory (or edit the one that's already there) and put the following few lines in it. That is all there is to it. GZIP is now enabled!

	<IfModule deflate_module>
		<IfModule filter_module>
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain text/html
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml application/xml application/xhtml+xml application/xml-dtd
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rdf+xml application/rss+xml application/atom+xml image/svg+xml
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/x-javascript
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/otf font/opentype application/font-otf application/x-font-otf
			AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/ttf font/truetype application/font-ttf application/x-font-ttf
		</IfModule>
	</IfModule>

If your installation of Apache does not have `mod_deflate` installed. You can also enable gzip compression using PHP configuration alone. In your `php.ini` file, you can simply add the following line anywhere: `zlib.output_compression = on`

= I'm a plugin developer. How can I prevent certain files from being cached? =

	<?php
	define('COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED', FALSE); // The easiest way.
	// or $_SERVER['COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED'] = FALSE; // Also very easy.
	// or define('DONOTCACHEPAGE', TRUE); // For compatibility with other cache plugins.

When your script finishes execution, Comet Cache will know that it should NOT cache that particular page. It does not matter where or when you define this Constant; e.g. `define('COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED', FALSE);` because Comet Cache is the last thing to run during execution. So as long as you define this Constant at some point in your routines, everything will be fine.

Comet Cache also provides support for `define('DONOTCACHEPAGE', TRUE)`, which is used by the WP Super Cache plugin as well. Another option is: `$_SERVER['COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED'] = FALSE`. The `$_SERVER` array method is useful if you need to disable caching at the Apache level using `mod_rewrite`. The `$_SERVER` array is filled with all environment variables, so if you use `mod_rewrite` to set the `COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED` environment variable, that will end up in `$_SERVER['COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED']`. All of these methods have the same end result, so it's up to you which one you'd like to use.

= What should my expiration setting be? =

If you don't update your site much, you could set this to `6 months`; optimizing everything even further. The longer the cache expiration time is, the greater your performance gain. Alternatively, the shorter the expiration time, the fresher everything will remain on your site. A default value of `7 days` (recommended expiration time), is a good conservative middle-ground.

Keep in mind that your expiration setting is only one part of the big picture. Comet Cache will also purge the cache automatically as changes are made to the site (i.e. you edit a post, someone comments on a post, you change your theme, you add a new navigation menu item, etc., etc.). Thus, your expiration time is really just a fallback; e.g. the maximum amount of time that a cache file could ever possibly live.

That being said, you could set this to just `60 seconds` and you would still see huge differences in speed and performance. If you're just starting out with Comet Cache (perhaps a bit nervous about old cache files being served to your visitors); you could set this to something like `30 minutes` and experiment with it while you build confidence in Comet Cache. It's not necessary, but many site owners have reported this makes them feel like they're more-in-control when the cache has a short expiration time. All-in-all, it's a matter of preference :-)

= EMERGENCY: If all else fails, how can I remove Comet Cache? =

Ordinarily you can just deactivate Comet Cache from the plugins menu in WordPress. However, if you're having a more serious issue, please follow the instructions here.

1. Log into your site via FTP; perhaps using [FileZilla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joXUMhr8PhU).

In other words, a cache is a temporary storage area where frequently accessed data can be stored for rapid access. Once the data is stored in the cache, it can be used in the future by accessing the cached copy rather than re-fetching or recomputing the original data.

= Prepare To Be Amazed / It's Time To Speed Things Up =

Comet Cache is extremely reliable, because it runs completely in PHP code, and does not hand important decisions off to the `mod_rewrite` engine or browser cache; also making Comet Cache MUCH easier to setup and configure.

In addition, Comet Cache actually sends a no-cache header (yes, a no-cache header); which allows it to remain in control at all times. It might seem weird that a caching plugin would send a no-cache header :-). Well, no-cache headers are a key component in this plugin, and they will NOT affect performance negatively. On the contrary, this is how the system can accurately serve cache files to public users vs. users who are logged-in, commenters, etc.

If you care about the speed of your site, Comet Cache is one of those plugins that you absolutely MUST have installed :-) Comet Cache takes a real-time snapshot (building a cache) of every Page, Post, Category, Link, etc. These snapshots are then stored (cached) intuitively, so they can be referenced later, in order to save all of that processing time that has been dragging your site down and costing you money.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= v160416 =

Requires WordPress v4.2+.

== Changelog ==

= v160706 =

- **New Feature! Apache Optimizations.** This release includes a completely new option panel for Apache Performance Tuning. Current options for Apache tuning include GZIP Compression, Leverage Browser Caching, Enforce Canonical URLs, and Send Access-Control-Allow-Origin Header (for Static CDN Filters). These options automatically add or remove from your `.htaccess` file the appropriate configuration based on the options you enable or disable (all options are disabled by default, so your `.htaccess` file is not modified unless you say so). If you prefer to update your `.htaccess` file manually, the necessary configuration can be viewed beneath each option. Props @jaswsinc, @renzms. See [Issue #789](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/789).
- **New Feature!** A new "Enable GZIP Compression" option has been added to the new Apache Optimizations panel. This option will automatically add the appropriate configuration to your `.htaccess` file to enable GZIP compression. This option is disabled by default. The old "GZIP Compression" panel has been removed in favor of the new option inside Apache Optimizations. Props @renzms, @jaswsinc. See [Issue #764](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/764).
- **New Feature!** Multisite Host Exclusion Patterns. It's now possible to exclude entire sites from the cache in a Multisite Network environment. Domain mapping is also supported! See _Comet Cache → Plugin Options → Host Exclusion Patterns_. If you're running a Multisite Network with Sub-Directories, you can exclude sites using the existing URI Exclusion Patterns feature. Props @kristineds. See [Issue #754](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/754).
- **New Feature (Pro)!** A new "Leverage Browser Caching" option has been added to the new Apache Optimizations panel. This option will automatically add the appropriate configuration to your `.htaccess` file to enable Browser Caching. This option is disabled by default. Props @renzms, @jaswsinc. See [Issue #764](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/764).
- **New Feature (Pro)!** A new "Enforce Canonical URLs" option has been added to the new Apache Optimizations panel. This options adds the appropriate `.htaccess` code to enforce the correct canonical URLs according to your WordPress Permalink settings (Comet Cache detects if the Permalink Structure ends with a trailing slash, or without a trailing slash). Props @renzms, @jaswsinc. See [Issue #554](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/554).
- **Bug Fix**: In some scenarios the Cron Event that cleans up expired cache files (`_cron_comet_cache_cleanup`) would never run, or the Next Run time would constantly reset to 1 minute away from running every time a page was reloaded. We suspect this is a race condition and in attempt to work around this issue we now skip all of our Cron-related checks if Cron is currently in the middle of running a process. Props @xberg and @lkraav for help reporting. See [Issue #653](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/653).
- **Bug Fix**: If your site uses aliased domains, Comet Cache now properly considers all possible domain variations when it clears the cache on WP Standard installations. Props @kristineds, @jaswsinc, @yoffe, and @VR51. See [Issue #608](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/608).
- **Bug Fix** (Pro): Fixed a bug where Comet Cache would appear to prevent WordPress from redirecting Permalinks that don't include a trailing slash, to the URL that does include a trailing slash. This was due to the fact that Comet Cache loads very early on (for caching purposes) and as a result the WordPress `redirect_canonical()` function never gets run. This was fixed by adding an option to the new Apache Optimizations panel that allows you to Enforce Canonical URLs. Props @renzms, @jaswsinc. See [Issue #554](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/554).
- **UX Bug Fix** (Pro): If you had your WordPress Dashboard login details saved by your browser, the browser autofill would automatically fill in the Pro Plugin Updater fields with those details, which then needed to be replaced with your actual Pro license details. The browser autofill has been disabled for those fields (tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). Props @renzms. See [Issue #741](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/741).
- **Enhancement**: Added links the Options Page for the Comet Cache [Twitter](http://twitter.com/cometcache) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/cometcache) accounts. Props @renzms. [Issue #771](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/771).
- **Enhancement:** Added full support for UTF-8 (multibyte strings). This release adds full support for UTF-8 throughout the Comet Cache codebase, greatly enhancing Comet Cache's ability to deal with file paths and URLs that may contain UTF-8 characters. Props @jaswsinc. [Issue #703](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/703).
- **UI Enhancements**: Improved the Logged-In Users and the Client-Side Caching options panels to dim additional options when the feature is disabled. Additionally, the "Enable HTML Compression for Logged-In Users?" option has been relocated from the HTML Compressor option panel to the more appropriate Logged-In Users option panel. See [Issue #768](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/768).
- **UX Enhancement**: Improved the inline docs for Auto-Clear List of Custom URLs to clarify that full URLs must be provided. Props @renzms. See [Issue #781](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/781).
- **Enhancement** (Pro): The Pro Plugin Updater has been improved to allow for better compatibility with hosting platforms that use Apache's ModSecurity. In some cases, site owners were seeing a 404 error when attempting to update the Pro version using the Pro Plugin updater because certain ModSecurity rules were blocking the Pro Updater requests. The Pro Plugin Updater now uses WP Transients to store the necessary metadata, which works around the issue with ModSecurity. Props to @seozones for reporting and @jaswsinc for help fixing this. [Issue #416](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/416).
- **Enhancement** (Pro): When Static CDN Filters are enabled, it's now possible to disable the automatic insertion of rules into your `.htaccess` file that are designed to prevent issues with [CORS](https://cometcache.com/kb-article/what-are-cross-origin-request-blocked-errors/). See _Apache Optimizations → Send Access-Control-Allow-Origin Header?_ See [Issue #787](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/787).
- **Enhancement** (Pro): The HTML Notes added to the bottom of a cached page now specify if the page was cached as the result of an HTTP Request or if it was cached by the Auto-Cache Engine. Props @kristineds. See [Issue #292](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/292).
- **Enhancement** (Pro): The Auto-Cache Engine now supports a fallback to cURL using the WP HTTP API. If your PHP configuration has `allow_fopen_url=0`, the Auto-Cache Engine will use the fallback to download the XML Sitemap and parse it from a temporary file. If you want to force the use of this fallback even when `allow_fopen_url=1`, you can use [a filter](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/440#issuecomment-228338371). See [Issue #440](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/440).
- **UI Enhancement** (Pro): A second button has been added to the bottom of the Pro Plugin Updater page that allows you to "Save and Update Comet Cache Pro" in one step. Props @renzms. See [Issue #741](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/741).
- **UI Enhancement** (Pro): The "Cache Stats" button in Admin Bar is now linked to the Cache Stats page. Instead of hovering over the button and then clicking "More Info" inside the popup panel, you can now just click the "Cache Stats" button to go directly to the Cache Stats page. Props @Presskopp, @renzms. See [Issue #780](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/780).
- **Comment Mail Compatibility:** Improved compatibility with the Comment Mail plugin by automatically clearing the cache whenever Comment Mail options are changed. Many of the Comment Mail options affect front-end portions of the site, so it's important that the cache is cleared whenever Comment Mail options change. See [Comment Mail Issue #278](https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/278#issuecomment-225994050).
- **PHP Compatibility:** Improved compatibility back to PHP 5.2 (the lowest version allowed by WordPress). Comet Cache still requires PHP 5.4+, but if you install Comet Cache on a site running PHP 5.2, it will now fail gracefully with a Dashboard notice indicating PHP 5.4+ is required, instead of producing a fatal error. See [Issue #784](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/784).
- **WP-CLI Compatibility**: Fixed a bug with deactivating Comet Cache using WP-CLI. Doing so was producing a "Invalid argument; host token empty!" error message. This has been resolved. Props @MarioKnight @jaswsinc @renzms. See [Issue #728](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/728).
- Renamed `COMET_CACHE_ALLOW_BROWSER_CACHE` constant to `COMET_CACHE_ALLOW_CLIENT_SIDE_CACHE`. Backwards compatibility has been maintained.
- Renamed `allow_browser_cache` plugin option to `allow_client_side_cache`.

= v160521 =

- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a bug that, in some scenarios, resulted in "PHP Fatal error: Undefined class constant 'CACHE_PATH_NO_PATH_INDEX'". This also affected the Cache Statistics feature (Comet Cache Pro), resulting in a blank panel when hovering over the Cache Stats button in the menu bar. See [Issue #752](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/752).
- **Bug Fix**: When the PHP OPCache extension is active, the OPCache is now cleared when a WordPress plugin is upgraded, activated, or deactivated. This works around an issue that could produce a fatal error when the PHP OPCache contains cached PHP code that conflicts with new PHP code introduced by an update. See [Issue #740](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/740).
- **Enhancement** (Pro): It's now possible to disable the WordPress Admin Toolbar when Logged-In User Caching is enabled with a new option in _Comet Cache → Plugin Options → Logged-In Users → Disable the Admin Toolbar for Logged-In Users & Comment Authors?_ Props @renzms and @KTS915. See [Issue #690](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/690).
- **Enhancement**: The the option to automatically clear the cache for Custom Term Archive Views (see _Comet Cache → Plugin Options → Automatic Cache Clearing → Auto-Clear "Custom Term Archives" Too?_) is now enabled by default. This feature was previously disabled by default, which lead to confusion about why those cache files were not being cleared automatically when a Custom Post Type with a Custom Term Archive View was being used. Props @renzms. See [Issue #693](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/693).
- **Enhancement** (Pro): A new filter allows overriding the default behavior to clear the user cache upon login and logout when caching for Logged-In Users is enabled. See [this article](https://cometcache.com/r/kb-article-how-can-i-prevent-the-user-cache-from-being-cleared-upon-login-or-logout/) for details. Props @KTS915. See [Issue #756](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/756).

= v160417 =

- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a "PHP Fatal error: Undefined class constant 'CACHE_PATH_NO_SCHEME'" introduced by the previous release (v160416). This issue only affected sites where Feed Caching was enabled (_Comet Cache → Plugin Options → RSS, RDF, and Atom Feeds_). Props to MassimoD and @emanwebdev for reporting. See [Issue #739](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/739).

= v160416 =

- **Enhancement**: Several PHP 5.4+ enhancements, most notably a conversion from PHP Closures to PHP Traits. See [Issue #635](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/635).
- **Enhancement**: Dashboard notices generated by Comet Cache now use the WordPress-style dismiss button to keep things consistent. See [Issue #719](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/719).
- **Enhancement**: Dashboard notices generated by Comet Cache are now compacted into a single notice that can be expanded to view details. This helps reduce the number of messages that appear when, for example, a Post is published or updated and several cache files are automatically cleared. Instead of showing a separate notice for each type of cache file that was cleared, a single notice is shown with a link to toggle the details. See [Issue #118](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/118).
- **Enhancement** (Pro): Improved the way the Auto-Cache Engine figures out the URL scheme (`http` vs `https`) that should be used when fetching the XML Sitemap. Instead of forcing `http`, whatever scheme is configured with the Home URL is now used. See [Issue #715](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/715).
- **Enhancement** (Pro): The Pro Plugin Updater page now includes a "Save All Changes" button at the bottom, allowing you to save changes to the updater configuration without actually running the plugin updater. Props @bridgeport @NoahjChampion @1wdtv. See [Issue #681](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/681).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a duplicated row of links on the Pro Plugin Updater page. See [Issue #696](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/696).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed an issue where some browsers would report "Failed to parse SourceMap" errors in their console when browsing the Comet Cache Options page. This was related to `sourceMappingURL` comments in the minified JS/CSS files that were intended for development purposes. Props to @1wdtv for reporting. See [#732](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/732).
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed a UI bug in the Pro Preview that was causing the Manual Cache Clearing panel to not appear as part of the Pro Preview. Props @renzms. See [Issue #711](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/711).
- **Bug Fix** (Pro): Fixed a bug related to the Pro Updater where some users who had migrated from ZenCache Pro to Comet Cache Pro were seeing an invalid new version message. Props @renzms @jaswsinc. See [Issue #727](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/727)
- **Bug Fix** (Pro): Fixed a bug with the Pro Plugin Updater that resulted in "Unknown error. Please wait 15 minutes and try again." when attempting to update Comet Cache Pro. The issue affected sites on servers running an old version of cURL (< v7.36) and/or an old version of OpenSSL, which made them unable to connect to the Comet Cache Pro update server. The Pro Plugin Updater now attempts to connect to a secondary update server that is more compatible with older versions of cURL and OpenSSL. See [Issue #678](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/678).
- **Hooks/Filters**: Comet Cache now hooks into `plugins_loaded` instead of `after_setup_theme` when calling its own setup routine. This improves integration with other plugins that may be expecting the Comet Cache API functions to be available after `plugins_loaded`. Props to Frank Goossens (@futtta) from Autoptimize for helping with this. See [Issue #716](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/716).
- **Compatibility**: Fixed a compatibility issue for some themes and plugins that were using old AC Plugin code designed to work with Quick Cache. This fix adds some backwards compatibility support for Quick Cache, but note that the first release of Comet Cache dropped support for Quick Cache backwards compatibility in favor of ZenCache backwards compatibility. See [Issue #710](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/710).
- **Compatibility: Query Monitor.** The Query Monitor plugin was reporting false-positive errors indicating that many Comet Cache methods did not exist. This was due to how the Comet Cache codebase was utilizing PHP Closures, which Query Monitor had a hard time handling. The codebase has been refactored to use PHP Traits instead of Closures and now the Query Monitor plugin has no problem recognizing Comet Cache methods. Props to @NoahjChampion for reporting. See [Issue #686](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/686).
- **Compatibility: WP-CLI.** When installing Comet Cache via WP-CLI, Comet Cache is now automatically enabled. There's no need to manually enable Comet Cache from within the plugin options after installing. Props @jaswsinc. See [Issue #464](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/464).
- **Required WordPress Version is now v4.2.** The minimum required WordPress version has been bumped from v4.1 to v4.2. See [Issue #706](https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/706).
