msgid "%1$s also supports multiple CDN Host Names for any given domain. Using multiple CDN Host Names (instead of just one, as seen above) is referred to as <strong><a href=\"http://cometcache.com/r/domain-sharding/\" target=\"_blank\">Domain Sharding</a></strong> (<a href=\"http://cometcache.com/r/domain-sharding/\" target=\"_blank\">click here to learn more</a>). If you configure multiple CDN Host Names (i.e., if you implement Domain Sharding), %1$s will use the first one that you list for static resources loaded in the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section, the last one for static resources loaded in the footer, and it will choose one at random for all other static resource locations. Configuring multiple CDN Host Names can improve speed! This is a way for advanced site owners to work around concurrency limits in popular browsers; i.e., making it possible for browsers to download many more resources simultaneously, resulting in a faster overall completion time. In short, this tells the browser that your website will not be overloaded by concurrent requests, because static resources are in fact being served by a content-delivery network (i.e., multiple CDN host names). If you use this functionality for Domain Sharding, we suggest that you setup one CDN Distribution (aka: Pull Zone), and then create multiple CNAME records pointing to that distribution. You can enter each of your CNAMES in the field below, as instructed."
